I worked as a full-stack developer intern at BuyerAssist. While working on the frontend, I worked with React and Keycloak to build the app's login system. In the backend, I was responsible for salesforce integration with the app. I worked with several AWS services using its SDK.

- AWS Appflow for fetching the data from a salesforce account
- AWS Lambda for executing specific functions on getting the data
- AWS S3 for storing the data
- AWS Eventbridge to link multiple lambdas depending upon the type of incoming event.
