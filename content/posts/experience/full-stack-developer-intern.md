I worked as a full-stack developer intern as buyer assist. It is a startup that aims to simplify and ease B2B transactions between companies. While working on the frontend, I worked with **React** and **Keycloak** to build the app's login system. 

In the backend, I was responsible for salesforce integration. I had to understand how salesforce works and how to make connected apps. It also involves several AWS services like 

* AWS Appflow for fetching the data from a salesforce account 
* AWS Lambda for executing specific functions on getting the data
* AWS S3 for storing the data 
* AWS Eventbridge to link multiple lambdas depending upon the type of incoming event.

**Internship duration:** 2 months

**Skills:** React, Docker, nodejs, salesforce

**Language:** Typescript
