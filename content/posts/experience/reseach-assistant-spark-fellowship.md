I was awarded the coveted SPARK fellowship to pursue a research

internship at IIT Roorkee under **Dr. Sparsh Mittal** (Assistant Prof, Dept. Electrical Engineering, IIT Roorkee). My work involved going through research papers to design novel architectures to achieve higher mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. I used a single shot detector (SSD) for object detection. I designed different models to increase the mAP with a minor increase in inference time. My main research area was centered around using various SSD architecture plugins to make it more scalable and easy to improve.

My idea of using feature-rich plugins with the model helped to increase the mAP(accuracy) by 3%. As a result of this, I **published** my work at the *9th IAPR TC3 Workshop on Artificial Neural Networks in Pattern Recognition, ANNPR 2020*. I then worked on another research paper

involving deep learning for object detection on aerial images from drones. The research paper was submitted to a reputed journal and is currently under review.

**Internship duration:** 3 months

**Skills:** Deep Learning, Object Detection

**Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
