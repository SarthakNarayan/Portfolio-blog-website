I worked under **Dr. Siddharth Tallur** (Assistant Prof, Dept. Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay). My work involved developing software to do motion analysis of a medium's particles and draw some inference about its intrinsic properties. I used different image processing techniques for tracking the motion of the particles. I also worked on a simulation to simulate the Brownian motion of particles. I then worked on developing a GUI for the software.

**Internship duration:** 2 months

**Skills:** Computer Vision, Statistical Analysis, Simulation (Pygame), GUI Development (Tkinter)

**Software:** OpenCV

**Language:** Python
