## So what is AWS DVA (Developer Associate) Certification

AWS Certified Developer - Associate showcases knowledge and understanding of core AWS services, uses, and basic AWS architecture best practices, and proficiency in developing, deploying, and debugging cloud-based applications by using AWS. Preparing for and attaining this certification gives certified individuals more confidence and credibility. Organizations with AWS Certified developers have the assurance of having the right talent to give them a competitive advantage and ensure stakeholder and customer satisfaction.

## Why did I decide to pursue this certification?

Last year, I successfully earned my AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) certification, which gave me a strong grasp of AWS core services and best practices for building and deploying scalable and highly available systems on the platform. However, I desired to gain a deeper understanding of AWS services for compute, storage, databases, and security, as well as best practices for building, deploying, and testing applications on AWS.

Therefore, I decided to pursue the AWS Developer Associate (DVA) certification as a natural extension of my SAA certification. By taking both exams, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of AWS services and their application in real-world scenarios, which I believe is highly beneficial for professionals working in cloud computing and IT industries.

> I believe studying for certifications can help in guided and motivated learning.

## Miscellaneous

- Before starting with this certification I had already given my SAA exam so it was not as daunting as giving an AWS certification for the first time.
- It took me close to **3 weeks** to get the certification including covering the course content and giving all the practice exams.
  - I used to study 2-3 hours daily and more on weekends (about 4 - 5 hours).
  - While preparing for this certification I was also pursuing my Master's in computer science at the University of Toronto.
- I gave the exam at a Pearson Vue center.
  - I felt the process was pretty smooth and much more relaxed than the online exam.
  - If you have the option, always go for an offline examination.
- I made comprehensive notes using obsidian.

## My tips for preparing for the certification

- Focus more on practicals. Try to implement the concepts being taught in the course.
- The certification focuses heavily on security, lambda, DynamoDB, and CI/CD systems.
- Take your time and don't rush through the course. You are doing this certification to learn more about cloud and AWS and not just for the sake of getting a certification.
- Try to give as many practice tests as you can and don't attempt the exams unless you can score an average of 80% or more in your practice tests.
- You can go through the FAQs on the AWS page if you want to but frankly, the course and the practice tests should be enough to cover most of the topics.
- Try to take notes while going through the course so that you can refer to them later.
- After giving practice tests make sure you go through the explanations properly even for the questions you answered correctly to know why the other options were incorrect.
- When you are answering questions try to eliminate incorrect options first. This technique has worked wonders for me.
- Always review the exam guide from the official AWS website. It will give you a clear understanding of what topics are covered in the exam.
