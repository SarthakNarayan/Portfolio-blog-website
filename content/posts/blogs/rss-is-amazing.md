RSS is amazing. But what is RSS? **RSS** stands for RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication. According to Wikipedia, <p style="color: #ffcccb; font-weight: bold"> RSS can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to check them manually. </p>
It's an old technology, and I am sure you would have seen it somewhere but with no idea what it does and why its there. It looks something like this.

So why am I talking about it now, and since it is so old, why should we know about it? Well, RSS can help you manage your information sources. 
With something new coming out every day, it is becoming more and more challenging to keep up. I can bet you have so many newsletters waiting for you to open them. Information overload becomes a real problem when you have multiple sources cluttering your inbox. 

A simple solution to this is RSS readers. RSS readers can help you subscribe to the feeds you love, sort them, and visit them whenever you want without cluttering your inbox (yes, you read that right).
<p style="color: #ffcccb; font-weight: bold"> You can have an RSS feed for your favorite youtube channels (using YouTube RSS extension), subreddits, medium publications, famous Twitter personalities, to name a few. You can also aggregate all the newsletters in your RSS reader. </p>

Example of my RSS feed

With the uses out of the way, let's see your best option for an RSS reader. I use **Feedly** since its UI/UX is modern and straightforward, and its search function for searching feeds is fantastic. But it limits you to only three feeds. If you want more feeds, you can check out **Inoreader**. Both of these readers are **freemium**. There are other options out there, but I would recommend you to stick to these two.
I use Feedly in conjunction with **Reeder** (mac and ios only) on my mac.
