The inventory management tool was built using Electron so that it can be used as a desktop application. Nedb was used as a local database for storing and retrieving the data. React, and bootstrap were used for the UI. Items could be added to the inventory and searched based on their SAP NO. 

Once searched using the SAP NO it would show the net amount of that item available in the inventory. The app also had to feature to export the result as a pdf.

**Language:** Javascript
