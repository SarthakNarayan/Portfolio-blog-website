It was a team project done along with my friends at RMI. We made a  motion tracker (HSV) using OpenCV to track the finger’s (or any object) movement. A parallel manipulator was made using a 5 bar mechanism that draws on paper. The arms were attached to a servo which was controlled using an Arduino. Serial communication was used to transfer information from the laptop (Python OpenCV) to Arduino.
