The bot had a unique articulating chassis which assisted its locomotion in uneven terrain. Assistive autonomy was included for easy control of the bot. RaspberryPi and Arduino were used for controlling the bot wirelessly. Wireless communication and wireless audio, video transmission were achieved using Robotics Operating System (ROS) over Wi-Fi with raspberry pi running ROS and acting as the transmitting node. The work was also published at the 4th International and 19th National Conference on Machines and Mechanisms (iNaCoMM 2019).

**Languages:** C for Arduino and Python for ROS
