During the pandemic, one of the most famous multiplayer games was Among Us. Although it had a chat feature, it lacked an in-game voice feature, which meant many people were using discord. The only problem being that you had to manually mute everyone when the round started and unmute them in meetings. This was a tedious process. So I decided to automate it by building a discord bot using the discord API. The project was hosted on Heroku.

**Language:** Javascript

**Backend:** nodejs

For more information on the project one can refer my notion notes that I took while building the project. It also contains some video references that I saw for this project.
